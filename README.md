# Javascript Quiz

## About

I was tasked with creating a quiz in Javascript with a number of features. For example having a timer and storing the score at the end of the quiz. 
          

The buttons are created dynamically through JS once you are through to the quiz see the image below for a snippet of the code

The task was difficult and I encountered a few issues. The main one being having to use local storage to set the score varibale from one JS file which handled the quiz and then on my second 
JS file get the score varible. 

## Deployment 

The project is live here - https://alistairhoughton.github.io/Javascript_quiz/
